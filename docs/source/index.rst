# MozDef Event Framework

A PoC using AWS + Serverless framework

This is a work in progess which will eventually be used as a template for external event sources.

The idea behind this work was to create a repeatable process for introducing new event sources to MozDef without having to specially craft it every time. While this is new and we haven't onboarded many sources yet, it is expected the function library may grow, and with it we will introduce further changes to this framework as it becomes more mature.
